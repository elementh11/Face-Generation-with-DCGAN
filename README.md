# Face Generation with DCGAN
This repository contains the Jupyter notebook and Python test files for my Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree project.

Description:
A DCGAN is trained on the CelebA dataset to generate images of new and realistic human faces.

## Dependencies

The project requires PyTorch and torchvision in order to run. The prerequisites are easier installed using conda:

`conda create -n faces python=3`

`conda activate faces`

`conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch`


### pip

To install torchvision with pip, you can issue `pip install torchvision`.
